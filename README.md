A Project for HacX! Hack for Public Safety

# Problem statement
SC2: Physics-based simulation of projectiles

Overview:
From time to time, SPF encounters cases involving the illegal use of prohibited and/or controlled items such as air guns or catapults/slingshots. This typically involves the user shooting projectiles (plastic beads, glass marbles or metal ball bearings) at people, animals, or objects, often in the act of mischief.

Problem:
There are instances where the path of the projectile needs to be determined to locate the position of shooter. Unlike bullets, the trajectory path of plastic/glass/metal projectiles does not travel in a straight line over relatively short distances. The trajectory also changes when the projectile deflects or ricochets off surfaces.

Aim:
Explore potential methods of accurately estimating the path of a projectile launched from a slingshot/air gun by way of modelling and simulation, even as it transverses through, or ricochets off, various materials (e.g. through glass windows, ricochets off car door etc.), and correlate the findings to locate the shooter.
